                  <p style="font-size: 2vw; color: black ; font-family: Montserrat,sans-serif;">I'm Jonathan Schoeck</p>              
              <p style="font-size: 1.2vw; letter-spacing: 0.1vw; color: gray ; max-width: 440px ; font-family: Montserrat,sans-serif;">My creative process reflects my interest in how people 
                                   experience the intersection of art and technology. How it affects
                                    communication, and the progress of our industry. While I've worked in just 
                                    about every discipline across the ad world, most of my big ideas live
                                     in the digital world, with a solid understanding of relevant design systems,
                                      user behavior, and support interfaces. I thrive on new technology, but have 
                                      a lot of nostalgia for antiquated tech as well. I appreciate unexpected uses 
                                      of APIs and data, just as much as I appreciate an early 60's BMW Airhead that's 
                                      in disrepair. Like most makers, I'm always making. I do a lot of it in my role
                                       with Boston based agency CTP, as Digital Associate Creative Director.
                                    I started my creative career client side, first at IBM, before transitioning to 
                                    advertising and marketing. In past roles at Digitas and MMB, I was involved in video
                                     and print campaigns, including branding, print, out of home, video, animation, 
                                     banners, social, and ambient media. But, I have spent the last few years using my 
                                     experiences with IBM to focus my digital expertise as it relates to marketing 
                                     communications.
                                    Iâ€™ve worked with dozens of brands across a broad range of industries,
                                     supporting teams across multiple agencies, and have gained regional and global
                                      recognition for our efforts. We've earned <strong style="color: black;">AdClub Hatch Awards, MITX Awards,</strong>  
                                      shout-outs in online publications for our work, and a nomination in
                                       the <strong style="color: black;"> Webby Awards.</strong> </p>
